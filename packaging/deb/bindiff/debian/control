Description: Find differences and similarities in disassembled code
 BinDiff is a comparison tool for binary files that helps to quickly find
 differences and similarities in disassembled code. It is used by
 security researchers and engineers across the globe to identify and
 isolate fixes for vulnerabilities in vendor-supplied patches and to
 analyze multiple versions of the same binary. Another common use case is
 to transfer analysis results from one binary to another, helping to
 prevent duplicate analyses of, for example, malware binaries. This also
 helps to retain knowledge across teams of binary analysts where the
 individual workflows might vary from analyst to analyst.
