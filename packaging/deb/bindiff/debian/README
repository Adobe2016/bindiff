BinDiff 4.3
-----------

BinDiff is a comparison tool for binary files that helps to quickly find
differences and similarities in disassembled code. It is used by security
researchers and engineers across the globe to identify and isolate fixes for
vulnerabilities in vendor-supplied patches and to analyze multiple versions
of the same binary. Another common use case is to transfer analysis results
from one binary to another, helping to prevent duplicate analyses of, for
example, malware binaries. This also helps to retain knowledge across teams
of binary analysts where the individual workflows might vary from analyst to
analyst.
